# Daemon readiness and trigger progress

A listening HTTP API does not mean startup has finished or that the daemon is
currently consuming trigger requests. Query `GET /readyz` to distinguish them.
This unauthenticated probe returns readiness booleans plus a disclosure-safe
startup phase and timestamp while startup is incomplete. It does not return
configuration, repository or gaggle names, run details, or credentials.

The response's `checks` includes:

- `apiListening`: the daemon has successfully bound its API listener.
- `schedulerReady`: startup admission is open and the scheduler has reported
  progress within the configured scheduler-liveness timeout.
- `triggerSweepReady`: startup admission is open and a trigger sweep completed
  successfully within that timeout. Failed sweeps do not refresh this check.
- `configLoaded`, `stateOpen`, `resumeComplete`, and `sweepsStarted`: the
  existing startup milestones.

During a long startup, `apiListening` can be true while `schedulerReady` and
`triggerSweepReady` remain false. After startup, a stalled trigger sweep can make
`triggerSweepReady` false even when the scheduler itself remains responsive.
The checks use in-memory timestamps so a stalled filesystem cannot block this
diagnostic request.

The top-level `ready` field and HTTP status retain their existing startup and
shutdown admission semantics: HTTP 200 when that gate is open, otherwise 503.
They are not recomputed from the diagnostic checks. Clients diagnosing trigger
delays should inspect `schedulerReady` and `triggerSweepReady`, not infer trigger
progress from HTTP 200 alone. `/healthz` separately reports process/scheduler
liveness, including the existing grace period before the first scheduler tick.

While `ready` is false, `startup.phase` identifies the operation currently
blocking readiness and `startup.since` reports when it began. The authenticated
`GET /api/v1/health` response includes the same phase plus its bounded target
(for example, the gaggle whose crash-orphaned worktrees are being recovered).
The dashboard uses the safe probe to explain startup progress before the full
portal becomes available.

No health probe is proof that an individual trigger was accepted or dispatched.
Use the trigger submission's own result for that decision; do not automatically
resubmit a request merely because a progress check becomes stale.

`POST /api/v1/triggers` requires an `Idempotency-Key` header (up to 256 bytes,
with no embedded control characters). Reuse the same key and payload when
retrying a delivery. If the JSON body includes `requestId`, it must match the
header after trimming surrounding whitespace; the header alone is sufficient.
The remote `goobers run` and pod priority-trigger clients transmit both values.
The daemon commits acceptance to `accepted-triggers.db` before returning HTTP
202 with `acceptanceId` and `state`. Acceptance can precede scheduler readiness;
it is not a promise that run admission will succeed. Retrying the same key and
payload returns the same acceptance identity and the recorded dispatch state.
`goobers run --no-wait` succeeds on that acceptance.

`--api-timeout` bounds remote root validation, including any wait for a
restarting daemon described below, and acceptance (default `30s`, positive
durations only). It does not limit the run's lifetime. If submission
times out, acceptance is unknown: retry with the request ID printed by the CLI
and the same workflow/options, rather than generating a new delivery.

Right after `goobers up` starts, API requests get HTTP 503 with a `Retry-After`
header until startup finishes. Until the full API is installed, every request
except the probes gets a plain-text `daemon is starting` reply. While crash
recovery then runs, every route that is not recovery-safe answers a JSON error
with code `recovering`. This window is expected after every restart; it is not
an identity, configuration, or permissions problem. CLI commands that send a
change through the daemon API (`run`, `run cancel`, `run abort`, `approve`,
`override`, `rerun-stage`, and `escalations resolve`) first confirm the
daemon's root identity, and they wait through this window instead of failing:
`goobers run` for up to `--api-timeout`, the others for up to 30 seconds. They
print a note while waiting and, if the daemon is still not ready when the wait
runs out, say so instead of reporting an identity failure. Any other identity
failure is reported immediately.

The daemon derives one run ID from the durable acceptance identity and passes
it through manual and priority dispatch. Reopening the queue does not allocate
a different run ID. This is the identity boundary for crash reconciliation,
not permission to blindly restart an already dispatched run.

The queue retains at most 10,000 records and refuses new requests when all slots
remain occupied. Only terminal records older than seven days can be pruned on
insertion; pending requests and uncertain dispatches retain their slots. After
a crash, the daemon reconciles `dispatching` records against matching published
run journals. Scheduler admission alone does not finish a record: the starter
runs asynchronously, so `dispatching` can include an assigned `runId` before its
journal is published. For unfinished dispatches captured before this daemon
started, absence from both normal and interrupted-prune journal locations
allows retry with the same run ID. A bounded startup snapshot excludes current
process dispatches from replay, even while their starters have not published
journals yet. Malformed, ambiguous, or inconsistent journal locations remain
unfinished for repair rather than authorizing a retry. Accepted engine runs
refuse execution unless the live journal writer is available.

Telemetry retention acknowledges an unfinished trigger from its matching
journal before deleting that journal, including interrupted-prune cleanup.
If acknowledgment fails or the identity does not match, retention preserves
the journal. Dry runs do not write trigger receipts.

Before dispatch, the daemon fsyncs a `runner.annotation` event with note
`trigger.dispatch.requested`, the authenticated actor, acceptance ID, request
ID, workflow, gaggle, and selected force/source-run options. An audit failure
leaves the acceptance pending. Dispatch-attempt annotations may repeat after a
crash; correlate them by acceptance ID rather than counting them as new runs.

Query `GET /api/v1/triggers/{acceptanceId}` with the accepting identity's bearer
to read `state`, `acceptedAt`, and any `runId` or refusal `reason`. This lookup
does not submit or dispatch a trigger. Other identities receive the same 404 as
an unknown ID. Pod callers need their state-scoped bearer and can read only
acceptances recorded for their own pod run. Status responses are not cached.
